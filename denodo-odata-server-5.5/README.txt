DENODO ODATA SERVER
=============================================================================

Denodo OData Server allows users to connect to the Denodo Platform
and query its databases using an OData 2.0 interface.

The project is distributed as a war file: denodo-odata2-server-5.5.war.
For running the Denodo OData Server you need to deploy this war file in a Tomcat
using Java 7 or later.

URLs are of the form http://localhost:8080/denodo-odata2-server-5.5/denodo-odata.svc/<DATABASE_NAME>

For providing VDP credentials Basic Authentication is used.

Also an HTTP client like Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) is recommended for testing this application.

For more info, see the User Manual at the /doc folder.

This software is part of the DenodoConnect component collection.
