HOW TO DISABLE AUTHENTICATION
-----------------------------

If you want to use a component that does not allow authentication you can 
disable it in the Denodo OData Service. Make sure that you disable the 
authentication ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS.

In order to disable authentication you must modify the web.xml file adding a context parameter:

    <context-param>
      <param-name>developmentModeDangerousBypassAuthentication</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>
