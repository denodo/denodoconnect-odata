MIGRATION NOTES FOR VERSION 20160909
====================================

Version 20160909 of this wrapper modified its artifact name as referenced in
the Virtual DataPort metadata, from "denodo-odata-wrapper-5.0" to
"denodo-odata2-wrapper-5.0".

This provokes that the standard, automatic metadata-based wrapper update
mechanism cannot be applied for updating to a version equal or newer than
20160909 from a previous version, and some steps need to be taken to
adequately keep the metadata for the affected databases (i.e. databases that
contain base or derived views that make use of the custom wrapper).

Steps to update the affected databases:
   
	1. Import new wrapper .jar into VDP using Tools -> Jar Management.
	2. Export VQL of the affected databases (at least all artifacts related
	   directly or indirectly with this wrapper).
	3. Manually change the wrapper references at the VQL file.
	4. Import the modified VQL into VDP.
 	5. Remove the old wrapper .jar from VDP using Tools -> Jar Management,
 	   which should now have no dependencies (and raise no warning).
